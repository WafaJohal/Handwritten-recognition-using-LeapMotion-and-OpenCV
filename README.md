# Handwritten-recognition-using-LeapMotion-and-OpenCV
This is my final project in my Image Processing. Data acquired by Leap Motion will be classified using KNN search.
Stage 1: Using it in existing data (file digits.png from opencv/samples/python2/data)
Code was based on: 
1. http://docs.opencv.org/ref/master/d8/d4b/tutorial_py_knn_opencv.html
2. http://my-tech-talk.blogspot.com/2012/06/digit-recognition-with-opencv.html

To compile, extract in a folder (e.g leapknn_first) and run:

$ cd leapknn_first
$ cmake .
$ make
